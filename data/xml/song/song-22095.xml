  <title>Banks of the Ohio</title>
  <subtitle/>
  <text>#
I asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

*
And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

#
I held a knife against his breast
As into my arms he pressed
He cried "my love, don't you murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity"

#
I wandered home 'tween twelve and one
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"
I've killed the only man I love
He would not take me for his bride</text>
