  <title>What a friend we have in Jesus</title>
  <text># What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear;
what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit, o what needless pain we bear,
all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.

# Have we trials and temptation? Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful, who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.

# Are we weak and heavyladen, cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge; take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer,
in His arms He´ll take and shield thee, thou wilt find a solace there.
