  <title>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine</title>
  <subtitle>This is my story</subtitle>
  <text># Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! 
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! 
Heir of salvation, purchase of God, 
bom of his spirit, washed in his blood!

* This is my story, this is my song, 
praising my Saviour all the day long. 
This is my story, this is my song, 
praising my Saviour all the day long.

# Perfect submission, perfect delight! 
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight! 
Angels descending bring from above 
echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

# Perfect submission, all is at rest. 
I in my Saviour am happy and blest; 
watching and waiting, looking above, 
filled with his goodness, lost in his love.</text>
