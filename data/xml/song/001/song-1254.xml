  <title>When peace like a river</title>
  <subtitle>It is well with my soul</subtitle>
  <text># When peace like a river attendeth my way, 
when sorrows like sea billows roll, 
whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, 
It is well, it is well with my soul".

* It is well (it is well) with my soul (with my soul). 
It is well it is well with my soul.

# Though Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come, 
let this blest assurance control, 
that Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
and hath shed his own blood for my soul.

# My sin - oh, the bliss of this glorious tho't! 
My sin - not in part, but the whole 
is nailed to his cross and I bear it no more. 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, o my soul!

# And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight, 
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll, 
the trumpet shall sound and the Lord shall descend. 
Even so" - it is well with my soul.</text>
